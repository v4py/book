    "\n",
    "When I suggest to fellow linguists that they might want to take up\n",

    "extract meaning from language data, I get a variety of responses. Among\n",
    "the negative ones, two tend to dominate: a fear that it might be too\n",

    "should I even care\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine these concerns in turn. Regarding the first one, it's\n",
    "never too late, trust me. I myself started programming at uni, and not\n",
    "even in my first year. Back then, I thought I was interested in literary\n",
    "studies, and it took me a while to realize that my interests lay\n",
    "elsewhere. Programming is perhaps the easiest skill to acquire from the\n",
    "comfort of your own home, without the need for formal training (though\n",
    "of course interacting with a live teacher can help jumpstart your\n",
    "learning). There's a wealth of resources available via the internet,\n",
    "this book being one example, and all you need to take full advantage of\n",
    "them is a computer and an internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like any other learning experience, it's also a [journey that never\n",
    "really ends](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202003/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_learn_python.html).\n",
    "There's always room for improvement and for learning more, so you might\n",
    "as well start now and get on with it. For my part, it's been almost ten\n",
    "years since I set out, and while I consider myself a fairly proficient\n",
    "programmer by this point, I learn new stuff all the time. If you're\n",
    "anything like me, that sense of curiosity that got you into linguistics,\n",
    "and perhaps even an academic career, is likely to be rewarded by\n",
    "pursuing programming as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would argue that this sense of curiosity is also what should prevent\n",
    "you from having that second kneejerk negative response, \"why should I\n",

    "likely the most useful skill I acquired since learning to read**. It\n",
    "really expanded the range of what I'm able to achieve not just in\n",
    "linguistics, but in everyday life as well. Our society increasingly\n",
    "relies on software to go about its daily business, and being able to\n",

    "tricks or gotchas addressed herein that will help you further refine\n",
    "your skills, though of course your mileage may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you've never programmed, have no background in linguistics\n",
    "and are not particularly computer-literate, reading this book might\n",
    "prove somewhat challenging, though not impossible with the right amount\n",
    "of dedication. If you make it through, or at least part-way, your\n",

    "```\n",

    "Python was also designed as a **general purpose language**, i.e. it is\n",
    "intended to enable its users to build all kinds of programs in a variety\n",
    "of different domains (though as every programming language, it\n",
    "particularly shines in some and is less well-suited for others). A\n",
    "possible disadvantage of this inclusive approach is that it may be a bit\n",
    "harder to find one's way around the ecosystem of tools and libraries for\n",

    "making these functions somewhat easier to use.\n",

    "As a consequence, with R, beginners tend to run up against a wall when\n",
